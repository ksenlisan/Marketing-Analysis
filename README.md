# Marketing analysis case study
## Exploratory analysis to investigate why is company losing money despite apparently efficient ad campaigns
In this project I analyzed marketing information (ad costs) and user data (registration, activity, purchases) to investigate why is the company loosing money despite apparent growth in user pool.
The data was acquired from Practicum course on Data Analytics.
This practice projects features advanced data manipulation (pandas, pivot tables, merges, grouping etc.), cohort analysis, computation of business metrics and visualizations (matplotlib pyplot).
